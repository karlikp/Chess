# ♟️ Chess
A console interface program enabling two players to engage in a game of chess.
The program will be respect the basic rules of chess.
Currently the program works but the chess control is not correct.

### 💬 Context of the project:
This was my main project from the third semester of my studies.
I developed it as part of a computer programming course.

### 🚀 My motivation:
I decided to develop this project because I have always liked this game.
I thought it would be satisfying to play using my own program. 
That's why I'm going to create a graphical interface

## 📌 To run the program:
1. Clone the repository
2. Change your working directory to the `Source` by cd `Chess/Source`

- On Linux `g++ *.cpp -I /Headers -o chess -std=c++20`
- On Windows by `g++ *.cpp -I \Headers -o chess -std=c++20`
4. Run the executable:
