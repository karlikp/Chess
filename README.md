# Chess_cpp
I'm going to develop the project to pass a programming subject at University of Technology.

I'm glad that you made decision to read something about me.

I study at Silesian University of Technology. 
Currently, I'm in the third semester.

I always like play in chess with my friends. 
I believe that developing this project will help me improve my programming competences.
So I will be able to develop more ambitious programming project in future.
